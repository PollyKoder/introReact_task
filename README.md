# Step by step - Task(Create a webpage with React)
After we'd had another and more in depth lesson about how Raect works and how to use both js and jsx to create and use components, we've now got the task to create a landing page using only components to push content to the html file.

# Requirements 
- Use the folder structure we've been taught during class
- Create a file in the folder that's called "Pages", name it "LandingPage.jsx" og give it some content
- Said content will be selected/collected from Components, where we can create whatever we'd like. 
 (ex: Title.jsx, Introduction.jsx, Welcome.jsx, etc)

 # Bonus
 - Take a look at how you can put together a button that changes color in React, to combine JS logic and returning it to HTML
